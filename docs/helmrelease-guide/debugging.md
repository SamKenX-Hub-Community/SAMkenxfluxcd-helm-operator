Even after having read everything this guide has to offer it is possible that a
`HelmRelease` fails and you want to debug it to get to the cause. This may be
a bit harder at first than you were used to while working with just `helm`
because you are no longer in direct control but the Helm Operator is doing the
work for you.

This last section of the guide will give you some pointers on how to debug a
failing `HelmRelease` resource.

## Getting the reason of failure

If a release fails the reason of failure will be logged in the Helm Operator's
logs _and_ recorded as a condition on the `HelmRelease` resource. You can view
this condition by describing the `HelmRelease` resource using `kubectl`:

```console
$ kubectl describe -n <namespace> helmrelease/<name>
...
Events:
  Type     Reason             Age   From           Message
  ----     ------             ----  ----           -------
  Normal   ReleaseSynced      55s   helm-operator  managed release 'default-podinfo-0' in namespace 'default' synchronized
  Warning  FailedReleaseSync  18s   helm-operator  synchronization of release 'default-podinfo-0' in namespace 'default' failed: upgrade failed:  "" is invalid: patch: [...]
```

In case of a release upgrade failure, the error as returned by Helm will be
recorded in the message of `FailedReleaseSync`. If this does not give a
conclusive answer the logs will likely contain more information about what
happened during the release process:

```console
kubectl logs deploy/flux-helm-operator
```

## Manually performing a release to debug

When describing the `HelmRelease` and the logs did not give any clues, it may
help to perform the release manually using the same values as specified in the
`HelmRelease` resource. When no `.valuesFrom` are defined, this can be done
by making use of [`yq`](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) (an extension to `jq`)
and `kubectl`:

```console
kubectl get helmrelease/<name> -n <namespace> -o yaml | yq .spec.values -y | helm upgrade -i <release name> -f - <chart>
```

## Getting help
